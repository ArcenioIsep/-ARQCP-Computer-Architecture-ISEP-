### 📘 Description

This repository contains the **assignments, exercises, and projects** developed for the **ARQCP – Computer Architecture** course at the *Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP)*.

The goal of the course is to understand how a computer operates at a **low level** — from hardware to software — through practical work in **C** and **Assembly** programming.

---

### 📚 Topics Covered

* 🧩 CPU structure and operation
* 💾 Memory organization and addressing
* ⚙️ Assembly programming (**RISC-V / x86**)
* 🔗 Integration between **C** and **Assembly**
* 🧠 Stack, registers, and function calls
* 🚀 Code optimization and performance analysis

---

### 🎯 Objective

Build a **solid understanding of computer architecture** and the **interaction between software and hardware**, providing a foundation for advanced topics like **Operating Systems**, **Compilers**, and **Software Engineering**.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* 💻 **C (GCC / VS Code)**
* 🧠 **Assembly (RARS / RISC-V / NASM)**
* ⚙️ **Makefile**
* 🌐 **Git & GitHub**

---

Would you like me to add a **“Project Structure”** section (with folders like `/src`, `/assembly`, `/docs`, etc.) to make it look even more complete for GitHub?
