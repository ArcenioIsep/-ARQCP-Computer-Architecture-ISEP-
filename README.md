### 📘 Description

This repository contains the **assignments, exercises, and projects** developed for the **ARQCP – Computer Architecture** course at the *Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP)*.

The course focuses on understanding how a computer works at a **low level**, from **hardware to software**, by developing practical skills in **C programming** and **Assembly language**.

---

### 📚 Topics Covered

* 🧩 CPU structure and operation
* 💾 Memory organization and addressing
* ⚙️ Assembly programming (**RISC-V / x86**)
* 🔗 Integration between **C** and **Assembly**
* 🧠 Stack, registers, and function calls
* 🚀 Code optimization and performance analysis

---

### 🎯 Objective

To build a **solid understanding of computer architecture** and how **software interacts with hardware**, forming a foundation for advanced areas such as **Operating Systems**, **Compilers**, and **Software Engineering**.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* 💻 **C (GCC / VS Code)**
* 🧠 **Assembly (RARS / RISC-V / NASM)**
* ⚙️ **Makefile**
* 🌐 **Git & GitHub**
